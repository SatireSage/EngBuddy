Some new features that are included are:\n- Meeting and Event Dates and Times are now accessible home screen\n- Announcements are easy to access from the website (if you are seeing this from the website, welcome! :D)\n- A slicker webpage while keeping everything important\n- And more ideas to be released!\n\nAs this is still in development (and you may catch some obvious bugs along the way which are being fixed at the moment), we are looking for suggestions on how to make this better for you guys. Feel free to offer suggestions either in our suggestions channel, DMing me, or the email mentioned on the website.\n\nBest of luck to everyone semester!\nhttps://www.sfu.ca/esss",
